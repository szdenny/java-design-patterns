# Hexagonal Architecture

---

# Also known as

* Ports and Adapters
* Clean Architecture
* Onion Architecture

---

# Layered architecture problems

* No clear application core
* Business logic leaks to the presentation layer

---

# Intent

* Application can be driven by users, programs, automated test or batch scripts
* Application can be developed and tested in isolation from its eventual run-time devices and databases

---

# Applicability

Use Hexagonal Architecture pattern

* When the application needs to be independent of any frameworks
* When it is important that the application highly maintainable and fully testable

---

# Concepts

* Ports are interfaces
* The ports that drive the application are called primary ports
* The ports that are driven by the application are called secondary ports

---

# Concepts

* Adapters are interface implementations
* Typically different adapters for testing and production are provided

---

# Real world examples

* [Apache Isis](https://isis.apache.org/) builds generic UI and REST API directly from the underlying domain objects
